Where a traditional puff pastry is made by wrapping a block of butter (beurrage) with a flour/water dough (détrempe) and then folded, this recipe does the reverse and folds the dough with the butter. It is no more challenging a method than the traditional way, but it does result in a remarkably flaky and tender puff pastry that rises evenly and rolls out easily.",
